# IBM-task

## Available Scripts

In the client and server directorys, you can run:

### `npm i`

And then

### `npm start`

## What you will find in this project

### - Main Page with the search for companies, where by entering the company's symbol in capital letters, you will get the company's information
### - By clicking on the company name on the card, you will find company stocks information
### - Purchase of company stocks (does not work completely)
### - Node.js local server

## Additional information 

### I tried very hard to make a proper diagram, but this is the first time I am faced with such a task, so I did not manage to make it well
### The server is not connected to the client dictionary, the problem here is that I am not faced with the creation of a local server, if it was possible to use the msql database, I could create a complete working application with login, register and transfer of the necessary information

## I faced a lot of problems in this task but I learned a lot, so I hope you will appreciate my efforts and give me the opportunity to work with you and become a professional in this field
